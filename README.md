# the-500-club


Used the creative freedom to decide I was going to build this from the client POV. I used a React frontend to see their date of purchase, purchase amount, and reward points with the funcionality to sort by month.

things I learned: react hooks and state management

things to improve: UI in general, added data visualization, sorting feature to also sort by increasing numerical date vs static rendering from mockdata. Originally built in a form to add in your own expenses but removed, could add that (I didn't see the realistic client value so axxed it)
